## Introduction: 
### What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process, involving a variety of techniques to maximize insight into a data set, uncover underlying structure, extract important variables, detect outliers and anomalies, test underlying assumptions, and develop parsimonious models.

## Main aspects of the project
1. The project mainly focusses on how a simple Decision Tree Classifier could be utilized in concluding employee's attrition rates.
2. A detailed Exploratory Data Analysis has been performed using the Pandas library and visualization tools such as matplotlib and Seaborn.
3. The major concerns of Employee Attrition has been addressed.
4. Feature engineering being a key factor that must be performed before testing the models has been tested with various features of the dataset.
